# State, Events and Forms

### State

- Data that a component can hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the apps lifecycle.
- Components memory.
- State variable: a single variable in a component (component state).
- Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component.
- State allows developers to:
    - Update the components view
    - Persist local variables between renders
